  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <h3>Staff Writer / Photographer / Videographer</h3>

  <h4>The Black Explosion</h4>

  <h5>Fall 2018 – Present</h5>

  <p>I began my time as a staff writer who covered numerous aspects of the University of Maryland, including protests, sporting events, and student life. I chose to take on the roles of photographer and videographer as well in order to supplement my own stories and assist my fellow reporters who weren’t as confident with a camera.</p>

  <h3>Social Media Coordinator / Intake Specialist</h3>

  <h4>Bright Futures Ahead</h4>

  <h5>Summer 2018 – Summer 2019</h5>

  <p>I helped with starting the development of the company’s website and social media, such as their Instagram and Facebook, during their first years after launch. In addition, I interviewed and kept in communication with newer clients in order to put their basic information in the intake system.</p>
